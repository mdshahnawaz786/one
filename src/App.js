      <p>Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
      shoes. Today we still sell shoes-as well as clothing, handbags,
      accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer
      service. customer experience and company culture. We aim to inspire the
      world by showing its possible to simuntaneously delivery happiness to
      customers, employees vendors, shareholders, and the community in a
      long-term,sustainable way.</p>
      <p> We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling
      shoes online, instead. they'll knowZappos as a service company that just
      happens to sell _____.</p>
